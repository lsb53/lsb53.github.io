## Overview

Some amphibian populations have evolved tolerance to pesticide exposure—a remarkable example of rapid adaptation to human-altered environments. This research explores the mechanisms and consequences of evolved tolerance, including potential trade-offs with disease susceptibility and other fitness components.

## Rapid Evolution in Action

Agricultural pesticide use has created strong selection pressure on amphibian populations breeding in farm ponds. In just decades, some populations have evolved significantly higher tolerance to specific pesticides compared to populations from non-agricultural areas.

This provides a compelling system to study:
- The genetics and mechanisms of tolerance
- Costs and trade-offs of adaptation
- Implications for population persistence

## Research Questions

1. **Mechanisms of tolerance**: What physiological or biochemical changes underlie increased pesticide tolerance?

2. **Evolutionary trade-offs**: Does tolerance to pesticides come at a cost to other fitness components?

3. **Disease interactions**: Are pesticide-tolerant populations more or less susceptible to infectious disease?

## The Trade-off Hypothesis

Adaptation rarely comes for free. Tolerance to pesticides might trade off with:

### Immune Function
- Resources allocated to detoxification may be unavailable for immune responses
- Tolerance mechanisms might inadvertently affect immune pathways
- Tolerant individuals might be more susceptible to pathogens

### Other Stressors
- Tolerance to one pesticide might not extend to others
- Cross-tolerance vs. no-cost tolerance vs. trade-offs

### Life History
- Growth rates, development time, or reproductive output might be affected

## Approach

### Common Garden Experiments

Comparing populations from agricultural vs. reference sites:
- Pesticide tolerance assays
- Immune function measurements
- Growth and development tracking

### Disease Challenges

Exposing tolerant and non-tolerant populations to:
- Ranavirus infection
- Parasitic infections
- Combined pesticide + pathogen stressors

### Genetic Analysis

Investigating the genetic basis of tolerance:
- Candidate gene approaches
- Genome-wide association studies
- Expression differences between tolerant and sensitive populations

## Broader Implications

Understanding evolved tolerance matters for:

- **Conservation**: Assessing the long-term viability of populations in agricultural landscapes
- **Evolutionary biology**: Documenting rapid adaptation to anthropogenic stressors
- **Ecotoxicology**: Considering evolutionary responses in risk assessment
