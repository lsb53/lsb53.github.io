This research explores how non-target wildlife populations evolve tolerance to pesticides and the potential ecological trade-offs involved.

## Population-Level Variation

Wood frog populations near agricultural areas show higher baseline tolerance to pesticides than do populations far from agriculture. I examined eight populations across an agricultural gradient.

## Trematode Susceptibility Trade-off

Individuals from populations located close to agriculture were modestly more susceptible to trematode infections than individuals from populations farther from agriculture. This suggests a potential cost of pesticide tolerance.

## Ranavirus Response

Ranavirus susceptibility showed no correlation with agricultural proximity. Notably, carbaryl exposure actually increased survival rates in ranavirus-infected tadpoles.

## Conclusion

This study provides evidence for a potential trade-off between trematode resistance and putative pesticide tolerance. The research demonstrates that pesticide exposure doesn't uniformly worsen disease outcomes.

## Phenotypic Plasticity

Separate work examined induced pesticide tolerance through stress responses. The findings indicated that exposure to the stress hormone corticosterone and predator cues induced tolerance to lethal carbaryl concentrations, suggesting pesticide tolerance can be induced by a generalized stress response.
