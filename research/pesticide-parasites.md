This research examines how pesticides affect free-swimming parasite stages, specifically focusing on the trematode *Echinostoma trivolvis*.

## Temperature-Dependent Effects

I investigated how pesticide toxicity varies with temperature. The study examined three pesticides—a carbamate insecticide, strobilurin fungicide, and triazine herbicide—on cercariae (free-swimming larvae). The main finding showed that temperature significantly influences pesticide toxicity, particularly for the fungicide tested.

## Population-Level Variation in Pesticide Tolerance

I assessed how different parasite populations respond differently to insecticides. The team tested three *Echinostoma trivolvis* life stages (egg, miracidium, and cercaria) across up to eight populations, exposing them to carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon.

**Notable findings:**
- Insecticide effects varied significantly among populations
- Chlorpyrifos exposure unexpectedly increased hatching success in some populations
- Cercariae showed inducible tolerance after prior sublethal exposure
- Tolerance levels were not correlated across different parasite life stages

## Implications

This research demonstrates that single-population toxicity studies may misrepresent pesticide impacts on parasites, and that agrochemicals can produce both expected and counterintuitive effects on non-target organisms.
