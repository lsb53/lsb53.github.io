## Overview

Agricultural chemicals don't just affect their target pests—they can have far-reaching effects throughout ecosystems, including on the parasites that infect wildlife. This research examines how pesticide exposure affects the survival and infectivity of free-living parasite stages, with important implications for understanding disease dynamics in agricultural landscapes.

## The Indirect Effects of Pesticides

While much research has focused on the direct toxic effects of pesticides on amphibians, less attention has been paid to how these chemicals might alter disease dynamics by affecting parasites directly.

Many parasites have free-living stages that:
- Are directly exposed to environmental contaminants
- May be more sensitive to chemical stress than their hosts
- Represent critical bottlenecks in transmission

## Research Questions

1. **Toxicity to parasite stages**: Are free-swimming cercariae and other parasite life stages sensitive to common agricultural pesticides?

2. **Sublethal effects**: Even at non-lethal concentrations, do pesticides alter parasite behavior, longevity, or infectivity?

3. **Net effects on disease**: How do direct effects on parasites combine with effects on hosts to determine overall disease outcomes?

## Study Systems

### Trematode Parasites

Trematodes (flukes) have complex life cycles with aquatic free-living stages that are potentially vulnerable to pesticide exposure:

- **Cercariae**: Free-swimming larvae released from snail intermediate hosts
- **Miracidia**: Larvae that hatch from eggs and seek snail hosts

### Common Agricultural Pesticides

This research focuses on pesticides commonly detected in amphibian habitats:

- Insecticides (e.g., chlorpyrifos, carbaryl)
- Herbicides (e.g., atrazine, glyphosate)
- Fungicides

## Experimental Approach

### Acute Toxicity Assays

Determining lethal concentrations for parasite stages across a range of pesticide types and concentrations.

### Behavioral Assays

Examining how sublethal pesticide exposure affects:
- Swimming behavior and host-seeking
- Longevity in the environment
- Penetration success when encountering hosts

### Infection Experiments

Testing whether pesticide-exposed parasites successfully establish infections and cause pathology in hosts.

## Significance

Understanding pesticide-parasite interactions is important for:

- **Agricultural landscapes**: Predicting disease dynamics in farm ponds and wetlands
- **Conservation**: Assessing cumulative stressors on amphibian populations
- **Pest management**: Considering unintended effects on wildlife disease ecology
