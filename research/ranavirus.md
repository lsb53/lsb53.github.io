## Overview

My dissertation investigates the drivers and impacts of ranavirus outbreaks in wood frog (*Lithobates sylvaticus*) populations. Ranaviruses are emerging pathogens that cause mass mortality events in amphibians worldwide, yet we still have much to learn about what determines epidemic outcomes.

## The Central Question

**What are the causes and consequences of ranavirus epidemics in wood frog populations?**

This seemingly simple question encompasses complex ecological dynamics:

- Why do some populations experience devastating outbreaks while others remain unaffected?
- How do environmental conditions influence disease transmission and virulence?
- What are the long-term population-level consequences of epidemic events?

## Research Approach

### Field Surveillance

I conduct intensive monitoring of wood frog breeding populations across Connecticut, tracking:

- **Disease prevalence** through systematic sampling and molecular diagnostics
- **Host population dynamics** including breeding adult counts, larval density, and metamorph production
- **Environmental conditions** that may influence outbreak probability

### Experimental Studies

Controlled laboratory experiments allow me to isolate specific factors:

- Temperature effects on host-pathogen interactions
- Dose-response relationships for infection outcomes
- Variation in host susceptibility among populations

### Molecular Epidemiology

Using genomic tools to understand:

- Pathogen strain diversity and virulence variation
- Transmission pathways within and between populations
- Evolutionary dynamics of the host-pathogen system

## Key Findings

*Research in progress - findings will be updated as the dissertation develops.*

## Broader Implications

Amphibian disease is a major conservation concern globally. Understanding the ecology of ranavirus epidemics can inform:

- **Monitoring programs** for early detection of outbreaks
- **Management strategies** to mitigate disease impacts
- **Predictive models** for assessing population vulnerability

## Collaborators

This work is conducted in collaboration with the [Skelly Lab](https://environment.yale.edu/profile/skelly) at Yale University and benefits from partnerships with state wildlife agencies and conservation organizations.
