Mass mortality events can have profound impacts on populations and ecosystems, yet are rarely studied in a systematic way.

## Field Surveys

During spring and summer 2021, I conducted longitudinal surveys at 40 wood frog breeding ponds in the Yale-Myers Forest in northeastern Connecticut. Die-off events were observed at approximately 20% of surveyed sites. I found that:

- Rapid spikes in ranavirus environmental DNA (eDNA) concentrations coincided with tadpole mortality
- High infection prevalence appeared 2-7 weeks before observable deaths
- Ponds without die-offs showed little to no detectable ranavirus eDNA

## Challenging Current Hypotheses

The timing of die-offs contradicted prevailing theories. Rather than clustering around specific developmental stages or environmental conditions, mortality occurred across a wide temporal window (May 24 – July 7) and at varying tadpole developmental stages and temperatures.

## Proposed Alternative Mechanism

I hypothesize that ranavirus die-offs result from buildup of infectious viral particles in the environment, which beyond a certain threshold generates a positive feedback loop of reinfection and increased viral shedding.

This research employs field manipulations, laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling to test this mechanism.
