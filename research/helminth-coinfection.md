This research examines how timing and species composition affect coinfection patterns in larval amphibian hosts exposed to multiple parasite species.

## Study Design

The study used *Rana pipiens* (leopard frog tadpoles) and two echinostome species: *Echinostoma trivolvis* and *Echinoparyphium* lineage 3.

## Main Findings

- Simultaneous exposure to both parasites produced higher infection loads than exposure to *Echinoparyphium* alone, but similar levels to *Echinostoma* exposure alone
- Sequential exposure revealed significant priority effects: tadpoles first exposed to *Echinoparyphium* had 23% lower infection loads than tadpoles first exposed to *Echinostoma*

## Research Significance

This work demonstrates that exposure order and timing meaningfully influence coinfection outcomes, even between morphologically similar parasite species. The research emphasizes the importance of molecular identification methods in parasitological ecological research, as traditional approaches may obscure functionally important species differences.
