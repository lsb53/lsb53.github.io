## Overview

Wild amphibians rarely harbor just one parasite species. Instead, they typically host diverse communities of helminths (parasitic worms) that may interact with each other and collectively impact host health. Understanding these coinfection dynamics is crucial for predicting disease outcomes in natural populations.

## Why Study Coinfection?

Traditional disease ecology often focuses on single host-pathogen pairs, but this approach misses important complexity:

- **Parasite interactions**: Different parasites may compete for resources, facilitate each other, or modulate immune responses
- **Cumulative impacts**: Total parasite burden may matter more than infection by any single species
- **Immune trade-offs**: Fighting one parasite may leave hosts vulnerable to others

## Research Questions

1. **Community structure**: What determines which parasites co-occur in individual hosts?

2. **Within-host interactions**: How do different helminth species affect each other's establishment, growth, and reproduction?

3. **Host consequences**: How does coinfection affect host condition, survival, and reproduction compared to single infections?

## Helminth Diversity in Amphibians

Amphibians host a diverse array of helminths including:

### Nematodes (Roundworms)
- Lung nematodes
- Intestinal nematodes
- Tissue-dwelling species

### Trematodes (Flukes)
- Kidney flukes
- Intestinal flukes
- Echinostomes (multi-organ)

### Cestodes (Tapeworms)
- Less common in amphibians but occasionally present

## Approach

### Field Surveys

Comprehensive parasitological surveys of amphibian populations to characterize:
- Helminth community composition
- Prevalence and intensity of infections
- Patterns of co-occurrence among species

### Dissection and Identification

Detailed necropsies to:
- Locate and count parasites in all organ systems
- Identify species using morphological and molecular methods
- Assess pathology associated with infection

### Statistical Modeling

Advanced analytical approaches including:
- Co-occurrence analysis to detect parasite associations
- Network analysis of parasite communities
- Models linking parasite burden to host condition

## Significance

This research contributes to:

- **Parasite ecology**: Understanding the assembly and dynamics of parasite communities
- **Disease prediction**: Better models that account for realistic infection scenarios
- **Conservation**: Assessing parasite-related threats to amphibian populations
