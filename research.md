# Research

My research integrates disease ecology, ecotoxicology, and amphibian biology to understand how environmental stressors shape wildlife health and population dynamics.

## Ranavirus Epidemics in Wood Frogs

My dissertation investigates the drivers and impacts of ranavirus outbreaks in wood frog (*Lithobates sylvaticus*) populations. Ranaviruses are emerging pathogens that cause mass mortality events in amphibians worldwide. I study how environmental factors, host traits, and pathogen dynamics interact to determine epidemic outcomes.

## Toxicity of Pesticides to Free-Swimming Parasite Stages

Agricultural chemicals don't just affect their target pests—they can also impact the parasites that infect wildlife. This research examines how pesticide exposure affects the survival and infectivity of free-living parasite stages, with implications for understanding disease dynamics in agricultural landscapes.

## Helminth Coinfection

Wild amphibians rarely harbor just one parasite species. I study how coinfection with multiple helminth (parasitic worm) species affects host health and how different parasites interact within hosts. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting disease outcomes in natural populations.

## Evolved Pesticide Tolerance

Some amphibian populations have evolved tolerance to pesticide exposure. This research explores the mechanisms and consequences of evolved tolerance, including potential trade-offs with disease susceptibility and other fitness components.
