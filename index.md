# Logan Billet

**PhD Candidate in Ecology**
Yale School of the Environment

Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Skelly Lab](https://environment.yale.edu/profile/skelly) at Yale University. My research focuses on understanding the causes and consequences of disease in amphibian populations.

My dissertation centers on a key question: **What are the causes and consequences of ranavirus epidemics in wood frog populations?**

More broadly, my research interests span:

- **Disease Ecology** — Understanding how pathogens spread through and impact wildlife populations
- **Ecotoxicology** — Investigating how environmental contaminants affect organisms and ecosystems
- **Amphibian Ecology** — Studying the life history, behavior, and conservation of amphibians
